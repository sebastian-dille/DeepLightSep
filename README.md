# Learning to separate Ambient and FLash Illuminants in a Single Image

This repository was created as part of the ML course at SFU, Burnaby in Spring 2020.

We have implemented a color-aware loss to address color shift in single image decomposition, especially targeted at seperating flash and ambient illuminantion in a single RGB image.

The code is a build upon the implementation described in the paper "Learning to Separate Multiple Illuminants in a Single Image, Zhuo Hui, Ayan Chakrabarti, Kalyan Sunkavalli, Aswin C. Sankaranarayanan, CVPR 2019" .
